# Regex Tutorial

This gist is a walk through of all things about Regular Expression commanly known as REGEX and how to use them. Regex is a string of text that lets you create patterns that help match, locate, and manage text. You can use to construct search strings for advanced find and/or replace searches. Perl, JavaScript, and PHP use Regex to easily find or manipulate information or to help decipher the work of other programmers. 

## Summary

We will explore how Regex is used to match Hex value. The Hex function returns a hexadecimal representation of a value as a character string. Hex
values are used for readability as well higher information density. 

In a Hex value the Regex would look something like: 

/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/ 

We will explore the deatils of the anchors, quantifiers, OR Operator, Character classes, Grouping and Capturing, Bracket Expressions as well as Greedy and Lazy Match.
